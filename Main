# Lab 5 The Bottle Return Program

# Step 1: Declare variables below 
totalBottles = 0
totalPayout = 0.0
continue_program = 'y'

# Step 2: Loop to run program again
while continue_program.lower() == 'y':
    totalBottles = 0
    totalPayout = 0.0
    
    # Step 3: Code to set value of variables
    for day in range(1, 8):
        bottles = int(input(f"Enter number of bottles for day #{day}: "))
        totalBottles += bottles
    
    # Calculate total payout (assuming $0.10 per bottle)
    totalPayout = totalBottles * 0.10
    
    # Print results
    print(f"The total number of bottles collected is {totalBottles}")
    print(f"The total paid out is $ {totalPayout:.1f}")
    
    # Prompt to continue
    continue_program = input("Do you want to enter another weekâ€™s worth of data? (Enter y or n): ")

# End While
